# Black_Jack_Game
This self developed project, developed in Python, is very similar to the well known Black Jack cards physical game.
The python file consists of minimal documentation.
It is not for commercial use and hence, there are certain comments included in the python file that I have kept for myself.
Developed  by Abhinav Gupta.
