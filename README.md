# Black_Jack_Game
This self developed project, developed in Python, is very similar to the well known Black Jack cards physical game.
The python file consists of minimal documentation.
The program is not for commercial use and undergoes some issues for some abnormal cases. 
Hence, there are certain comments included in the python file that I have kept for myself.
